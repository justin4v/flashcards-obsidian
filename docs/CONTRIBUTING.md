## How to build?
You need to pull the repository, install the dependencies with `node` and then build with the command `npm run dev`. It will automatically move the files into the `docs/test-vault` and hot reload the plugin.

    $ git clone git@github.com:reuseman/flashcards-obsidian.git
    $ cd flashcards-obsidian
    ~/flashcards-obsidian$ npm install
    ~/flashcards-obsidian$ npm run dev
