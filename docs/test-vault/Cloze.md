cards-deck: Cloze
---

# Cloze
The **Cloze deck** must contain **4 cards** defined in the section [[#Must work ✔️]].

## Must work ✔️

This is a valid ==cloze== that exploits the ==Obsidian Highlight== syntax.

The other mechanism is the {following one} with these parenthesis.

Moreover, the {2:order} of the {1:cloze} support can vary.

And of course {multiple syntax} can be ==mixed== together.

## Must NOT work ❌

### Code blocks
```java
System.out.println("Hey this is not a {valid} one");
```

## Delimiters inside inline code blocks
Suppose to have the following situation `==` where you talk about the equal operator of Haskell and then you talk again about it `==`. Then this must not be considered as a cloze card.

### Math blocks
$$-\frac{1}{12}$$

## Math inline
This is not a good cloze $\frac{3}{2}$
